      <title>Create a Debian Cloud-init Template on Proxmox</title>
      <link>https://www.aidenwebb.com/posts/create-a-debian-cloud-init-template-on-proxmox/</link>

      <description>Cloud-init is the industry standard multi-distribution method for cross-platform cloud instance initialization. It is supported across all major public cloud providers, provisioning systems for private cloud infrastructure, and bare-metal installations.
Using Proxmox templates in tandem with Cloud-init streamlines the process of launching new VMs. With this approach, a template can rapidly generate a new VM, and Cloud-init takes care of the initial setup during boot, reducing your tasks to simply setting up the hostname and initial user account.</description>

      <description>The Problem Microsofts latest update to Office 365 has changed the way &amp;ldquo;Share&amp;rdquo; function operates. Previously, when you clicked the &amp;ldquo;Share&amp;rdquo; button, you were presented with a list of options, including sharing a link, or attaching a copy of your document instead.
Now, if the file you are working on is already saved in a shareable OneDrive or Sharepoint locationsync&amp;rsquo;d, the only option you are presented is to share a link to the document.</description>

      <description>Yesterday Microsoft announced a new critical vulnerability CVE-2023-23397, a vulnerability in Microsoft Outlook that allows a threat actor to harvest NTLMv2 hashes via a specifically crafted Outlook appointment.
Microsoft state that attackers can exploit this vulnerability by sending an email that triggers automatically when it is retrieved and processed by the Outlook client. This can lead to exploitation BEFORE the email is viewed in the Preview Pane.
They also state that this vulnerability is being actively exploited in the wild.</description>

      <description>Do you relate to the cover photo? Have your NTFS permissions just bombed out and you can&amp;rsquo;t bare the idea of waiting hours or days for your new permissions to apply?
Don&amp;rsquo;t worry, I&amp;rsquo;m here to help.
It&amp;rsquo;s no secret that applying NTFS permissions to any directory tree larger than a few thousand files quickly decends in to a painstaking waiting game. The built in UI is garbage, and icacls is decent but single-threaded and slow.</description>

      <description>I have a hell of a lot of mail accounts, K-9 Mail on Android helps me manage them all. Here&amp;rsquo;s how to set up K-9 Mail with Office 365.
You will first need to set up SMTP Auth on your Exchange Tenant. This is a simple process, but it does require you to have access to the Exchange Admin Centre. If you don&amp;rsquo;t have access to the EAC, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to ask your Exchange Admin to do this for you.</description>

      <description>You know the drill, as the kid with the tech skills you get roped into helping your parents and other family members with their busted tech. I notice that every time I ressurect or reincarnate the treasured device of a family member I end up installing much of the same software. I wrote this to save me some time, and to help others who are in the same boat.
My preferred recommendation in each category is in bold.</description>

      <title>How to replace SSL certificates for a custom domain in Self Hosted 3CX</title>

      <description>3CX have updated their docs and removed help.3cx.com meaning the old documentation for updating SSL certs is now gone, or at least harder to find.
The original URL was https://help.3cx.com/help/en-us/33-installation/148-how-can-i-replace-the-ssl-certificates-for-a-custom-domain. If anyone has a copy of this page, please let me know.
Thankfully updating the SSL certificate is relatively straight forward as the web client runs on nginx.
Updating the SSL Certificate Prerequisites You will need:
Access to the server running 3CX Remote Desktop (Windows) SSH (Linux) The certificate and private key in PEM format Updating the Certificate Locate the certificate folder (default):</description>

      <description>I occurs to me that each time I set up a new system, or re-install my workstation, I often end up hunting down and redownloading tools and software that I use on a regular basis. So I thought I&amp;rsquo;d create a list of useful tools and pop it here on my blog for future reference and to share with others.
I&amp;rsquo;ll try to keep this list updated as I find new tools and software that I find useful.</description>

      <title>Dockers seven network types and when to use them</title>

      <description>1. The Default Bridge This is the default network that new containers will connect to. It&amp;rsquo;s a software bridge between your docker instance and your host system, providing isolation between the bridge network and other networks, including the host network and other bridge networks on the host. Docker best practices discourage using this network for containers, recommending User-Defined bridges instead, which we will get to in #4.
When to use it: Avoid using the Default Bridge, use another network type instead where possible</description>

      <description>Authentication Authentication is saying &amp;ldquo;I am me&amp;rdquo;. It validates who you are. When you go to a club and the bouncer stops you and you tell him you&amp;rsquo;re on the guest list, you then show him your ID and he says &amp;ldquo;Ahh! You&amp;rsquo;re that guy, come on in&amp;rdquo; - that&amp;rsquo;s Authentication
Authorisation Authorisation validates what you claim to be. Going back to the club and the bouncer stops you. You show him your ID.</description>

      <description>Submodules aren&amp;rsquo;t removed using git rm submodule-dir, they need to be removed in a far more thorough and annoying fashion. There are a number of unclear explanations at various sources so I decided to write my own findings.
Delete the relevant parts from the .gitmodules file.
EG:
1 2 3 [submodule &amp;#34;blog/themes/PaperMod&amp;#34;] path = blog/themes/PaperMod url = https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod.git Stage .gitmodules via git add .gitmodules

      <description>Introduction I recently came to the conclusion that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t posting on my blog nearly as much as I&amp;rsquo;d like to. My blog runs on WordPress, and I&amp;rsquo;ve felt for a while that the process of logging in, creating a post, fixing formatting in a WSYWGI editor and eventually posting was too much resistance when I commonly just write notes in plain text. So, why not just write posts in plain text and have something else do the work of turning that in to a post or a blog?</description>

      <description>The Problem You&amp;rsquo;ve set up Azure AD Connect or Azure AD Connect Cloud Sync, but some users haven&amp;rsquo;t sync&amp;rsquo;d correctly. Trying to force a new sync / Soft Link based on SMTP or UPN matching doesn&amp;rsquo;t work. These sync&amp;rsquo;d users may have created new Azure AD accounts, or may have failed to create an Azure AD account altogether. Your internal users UPN matches a domain configured in Azure AD.
The Cause The initial soft link matches on UPN or SMTP, but may fail if there are conflicting ProxyAddresses.</description>

      <description>Introduction ITIL defines an incident as “an unplanned interruption to or quality reduction of an IT service”.
In order to minimise disruption caused by an incident and restore normal service as quickly as possible, it&amp;rsquo;s vital to have an efficient incident management process. Unfortunately, this is something a lot of IT teams get wrong.

      <guid>https://www.aidenwebb.com/posts/how-to-check-if-your-cpu-supports-virtualisation/</guid>
      <description>Check Task Manager The first, simplest option to check is to open task manager. Click the performance tab Check if Virtualisation is Enabled If Virtualisation is not Enabled, this could be due to it being disabled in the BIOS. Before enabling it, check if your processor is compatible.
Check Processor Compatibility Identify your Processor Press the Windows Key Type &amp;ldquo;System Information&amp;rdquo; in the search box Make a note of your processor make and model Check Product Specs - Intel: If your processor is Intel, go to the Intel Product Specification Page and look up your processor model and open the specification page.</description>

      <description>The Problem You&amp;rsquo;re trying to connect to your NAS&amp;rsquo;s web interface but it&amp;rsquo;s just spinning forever and not actually loading.
The Cause The cause can be a number of things, but it boils down to an issue with the http service or proxy service on the QNAP.
Sometimes a configuration problem will cause the service to behave badly. A firmware update may cause a mismatch between the config file and the service being run.</description>

      <title>Why “traverse folder” and “execute file” is a combined NTFS permission</title>
      <link>https://www.aidenwebb.com/posts/why-traverse-folder-and-execute-file-is-a-combined-ntfs-permission/</link>

      <guid>https://www.aidenwebb.com/posts/why-traverse-folder-and-execute-file-is-a-combined-ntfs-permission/</guid>
      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been asked why the Advanced Permissions dialogue on NTFS folders lists &amp;ldquo;Traverse folder / execute file&amp;rdquo; as one single permission.
On the surface it seems counterintuitive that you&amp;rsquo;d allow a user to navigate through a folder, or execute its contents.
There&amp;rsquo;s no official Microsoft documentation on the design decisions, however, from a filesystem perspective, entering a folder is the same as executing or running it. The same is true of 3 classic Unix filesystem flags and permissions, where the &amp;ldquo;X&amp;rdquo; flag allows both directory traversal and file execution, while &amp;ldquo;R&amp;rdquo; allows reading and &amp;ldquo;W&amp;rdquo; allows writing.</description>
